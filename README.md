 ## Brig Motors Car Sales Analysis
 
## Project Overview
This project analyses historical vehicle sales data for Bright Motors to identify patterns, trends, and opportunities that can improve sales performance, inventory strategy, and regional marketing decisions.
The dataset includes vehicle characteristics, pricing, mileage, sales locations, and sale dates.
This analysis was completed in Google Sheets, using Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts to explore the data from multiple perspectives.
## Dataset Information
The dataset contains the following key fields:
YEAR – Vehicle manufacture year
MAKE – Brand of vehicle
MODEL / TRIM / BODY – Vehicle specification
ODOMETER – Vehicle mileage
STATE – Sales region
MMR – Market price estimate
SELLINGPRICE – Final sale price
SALEDATE – Transaction date
A new calculated field was added:
TOTAL_REVENUE = SELLINGPRICE
## Key Analyses and Insights
 
 1. Revenue & Mileage by Year of Manufacture
Charts Used:
Bar chart (Total Revenue)
Line chart (Average Odometer)
Insights:
2008 generated the highest revenue.
Older vehicles (2005–2007) have higher mileage, while newer vehicles (2014) have significantly lower mileage.
There is a negative correlation between mileage and revenue:
newer cars (lower mileage) generally maintain higher selling prices.

 3. Revenue by Vehicle Make
Charts Used:
Bar chart
Trend line chart
Insights:
Dodge is the top-performing brand, generating the highest revenue.
Ford and Mercedes-Benz also show strong revenue performance.
GMC, Jeep, and Land Rover show lower revenue contribution compared to leading brands.

 4. Revenue by State
Charts Used:
Bar chart,
Donut chart,

The states with the highest total revenue are:
CA (California)
FL (Florida)
PA (Pennsylvania)
Regions such as NC, NV, and VA show lower total revenue, suggesting opportunities for targeted marketing.

 5. Average Mileage Trends
Charts Used:
Line chart
Insights:
Mileage consistently decreases in newer model years.
Vehicles from 2014 have the lowest average odometer readings.
This shows that the dealership handled both older, high-mileage inventory and newer, better-condition vehicles.

## Business Recommendations
 1. Increase Inventory of High-Performing Makes
Focus on acquiring more Dodge, Ford, and Mercedes-Benz vehicles, which generate the strongest revenue.
 2. Prioritize Newer, Low-Mileage Vehicles
Newer cars (e.g., 2012–2014 models) show:
Higher demand
Better resale value
Higher margins
This can significantly improve revenue.
 3. Strengthen Marketing in High-Value Regions
Target regions such as:
California
Florida
Pennsylvania
These areas consistently produce the highest total revenue.
 4. Improve Sales Strategy in Lower-Revenue Regions
States with lower sales (NC, NV, VA) could benefit from:
Local promotions
Partnerships with used car dealers
Campaigns highlighting affordability or financing options


## Tools & Methods Used
Google Sheets
Pivot Tables
Pivot Charts
Data Cleaning (removing duplicates, standardizing fields)
Custom Calculations (Total Revenue)

## Conclusion
This project reveals clear trends in Bright Motors’ sales data. Revenue is shaped by vehicle make, model year, mileage, and sales region. By focusing on high-value brands, newer cars, and top-performing regions, the dealership can significantly increase profitability and operational efficiency.
The analysis provides a strong foundation for strategic planning and future data-driven decisions.
